Prob-1 is a thick 100cm block of polyethylene with a steel bar acting as a streaming channel through the block.

Prob-2 is a large labyrinth that has a source at the left side end and a detector on the right side end. The passages are 50 cm wide and 200 cm tall.

Prob-4 is a thick shielding wall made of polyethylene with steel support structures running through it. A source sits on the left side of the wall and a NaI detector on the right side.

The Beam problem is a beam source of neutrons directed towards a piece of NaI. There is NaI in line with the source and offset from the target NaI that acts as a detector for reflected neutrons.

The reactor problem is a model of a reactor containment building based on an ABWR. This model has air penetrations and a NaI detector at the end of one of the penetrations.

The WS-problem is geometry used in the Wilson and Slaybaugh paper. This is a fission source and a large water block separated by a steel block. A steel beam is connected to the steel block that runs the length of the water block.

The therapy room is a test based of a radiation therapy vault. There is a water phantom that sits in the main room, upon which 48.5 MeV neutrons are incident from a beam source. A NaI sits at the end of a labyrinth connected to the main treatment room.
